A Gleam implementation of PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) for Erlang. Heavily indebted to [erlang-pbkdf2](github.com/whitelynx/erlang-pbkdf2).

Currently a work in progress!

```sh
gleam add pbkdf2@1
```
```gleam
import pbkdf2

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/pbkdf2>.

## Development

gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
